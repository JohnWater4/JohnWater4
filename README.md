- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnWater4
- 👀 I’m interested in virtually everything, and mechanically inclined...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning freecad BUT the learning curve is quite steep, as I discarded windows and changed to linux...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different issues...
- 📫 How to reach me is an open question, although I do read my eMails every day...
At first I will like to lurk in the shadows, untill I can see my way open to start interacting.
